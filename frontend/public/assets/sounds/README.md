# Sound Effects Setup

The system expects a `hammer.mp3` file in this directory:
`c:\xampp\htdocs\cric_auction_new\frontend\public\assets\sounds\`

## 1. Download Sound
I used a placeholder file, so you won't hear anything yet. Please download a real "Gavel" sound effect (MP3) from a free source:
- [OrangeFreeSounds - Gavel](https://orangefreesounds.com/gavel-sound-effect/)
- [SoundBible - Gavel](https://soundbible.com/tags-gavel.html)

## 2. Install
1. Download the MP3.
2. Rename it to `hammer.mp3`.
3. Overwrite the placeholder file in this directory.

## 3. Test
Go to the Auction Room and place a bid!
